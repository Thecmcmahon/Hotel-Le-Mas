           <h3>Seeing the Sights of Southern France</h3>
           <p>Le Mas is a quite little town which is nice and relaxing, but if you want more shops or more things to do, we can go to the city Nice which is about an hour and a half away, with scenic rides the whole way.</p>

           <h3>Trips to the Beach</h3>
           <p>You can't go to the south of France and not check out the beautiful beaches. Similar to the trip to Nice, David will bring you to a beach of your choice. One is a very relaxed beach and the other has more to offer with bars and other activities on the beach.</p>
